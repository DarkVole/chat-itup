PART 1.

We are going to change App.js so that a property named activeRoom is in the constructor. We are then going
to add a method named setRoom that will be passed in as a prop to RoomList.

In RoomList when a user clicks a "room" the setRoom method will be triggered and passed in the room "key". setRoom will then store this information on the activeRoom property.


If you run the application and click on a room the key for that room will log to the console.
